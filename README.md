# **Boost Asio File Change Notifier**  

A **C++ project** using **Boost.Asio** and **inotify** to monitor file changes in a specified directory and send notifications to a remote server. This client-server system allows tracking **file creations, modifications, and deletions** in real-time.

## üöÄ Features
### **Client Side**
- Monitors a folder (and its subdirectories) for file changes.
- Uses **inotify** to detect **created, modified, and deleted** files.
- Sends change notifications to the server over **Boost.Asio TCP**.
- Simple command to **exit** the client safely.

### **Server Side**
- Listens for file change notifications from the client.
- Logs received file events to the console.
- Graceful handling of **client disconnects**.
